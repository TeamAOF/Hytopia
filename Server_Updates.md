### Overview

This update introduces a **unified, progressive damage scaling system** across **all combat styles**.
The goal is to reduce early-game power spikes, control late-game damage stacking, and preserve long-term build progression.

---

## Global STAT_DAMAGE Changes

### Affected Combat Styles

The following now share **one identical damage progression curve**:

* **Melee** (Swords, Daggers, Axes, Maces, Spears, etc.)
* **Ranged** (Archery)
* **Magic** (Staves)
* **Unarmed** (if applicable)

All `STAT_DAMAGE` bonuses—weapon-specific and *Damage (All)*—have been rebalanced accordingly.

---

### New Progressive Damage Curve (Rounded)

| Tier | Previous Bonus | New Bonus |
| ---- | -------------- | --------- |
| 2    | +10%           | **+6%**   |
| 3    | +15%           | **+8%**   |
| 4    | +20%           | **+10%**  |
| 5    | +25%           | **+10%**  |
| 6    | +35%           | **+14%**  |
| 7    | +50%           | **+16%**  |
| 8    | +65%           | **+20%**  |
| 9    | +75%           | **+20%**  |
| 10    | +100%          | **+24%**  |

* All values are **rounded to even numbers**
* The same curve applies across **every combat tree**
* No per-weapon exceptions

---

## Total Damage Impact

| Build State            | Old System    | New System        |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Full damage investment | +395% (×4.95) | **+128% (×2.28)** |

---

## Design Intent

* **Early game:**
  Damage progression is slower and more controlled, emphasizing gear, positioning, and player skill.

* **Mid game:**
  Damage increases steadily without sudden spikes.

* **Late game:**
  Full investment is still rewarding, but no longer trivializes enemies, defenses, or combat mechanics.

---

## Additional Notes

* Critical chance, lifesteal, parry bonuses, XP bonuses, and non-damage stats are **unchanged**
* This system is **future-proof**: new weapons automatically inherit the same curve
* Combat style identity is preserved through **non-damage stats**, not raw scaling

---

# 🔮 Enchanting Balance Update

This update significantly reworks **enchanting costs and progression** to better reflect power scaling and long-term progression.

---

## ⚙️ Enchantment Cost Scaling Overhaul

### 📈 Exponential Cost Scaling

* Enchantment scroll recipes now scale **exponentially by tier**:

  * **Tier 1:** ×1 (unchanged)
  * **Tier 2:** ×4
  * **Tier 3:** ×9
  * **Tier 4:** ×16
* Applies to all scalable ingredients (essences, bars, crystals, plants, etc.)
* All values are rounded **up** to whole numbers

This makes higher-tier enchantments a meaningful investment rather than a linear upgrade.

---

## 🧵 Fabric Scrap (Cindercloth) Changes

* Fabric_Scrap_Cindercloth now scales **linearly by tier** instead of remaining flat:

  * **Tier 1:** 5
  * **Tier 2:** 8
  * **Tier 3:** 13
  * **Tier 4:** 20
* Keeps early enchanting accessible while discouraging mass high-tier crafting

---

## 💀 Tier 3 Enchantment Tax (New)

All **Tier 3 enchantment scrolls** now require additional rare materials:

* **+25 Void Essence**
* Plus **one** of the following:

  * **1 Emerald** (if the recipe did not already include gems)
  * **1 Concentrated Life Essence** (if the recipe already uses gems)

This change is intended to:

* Slow Tier 3 enchantment spam
* Force engagement with higher-end resource systems
* Make Tier 3 a deliberate progression choice

---

## 🛠️ Enchanting Table Upgrade Scaling

Enchanting table upgrades now follow the same tier-based scaling philosophy:

### Upgrade Costs

* **Upgrade 1 (Tier 1):** Unchanged
* **Upgrade 2 (Tier 2):** Costs ×4
* **Upgrade 3 (Tier 3):** Costs ×9

### Upgrade 3 Additional Cost

* **+25 Void Essence** added as a Tier 3 upgrade tax

Single-count unique items (gems, Voidheart) are **not multiplied**.

---

## 🎯 Design Goals

* Make enchanting progression feel **earned**, not spammed
* Preserve early-game experimentation
* Push Tier 3+ enchantments firmly into **late-game territory**
* Improve long-term economy balance on servers

# 🧌 Elite Mobs 2.0

# 📜 **Hear Ye, Wayfarers of the Realm!** 🐎

Word spreads along the trade roads and campfires burn late with rumors…
**Nomad Tamers have arrived.**

Wandering beast-masters have crossed into our lands, bringing with them ancient knowledge of how to **befriend, tame, and ride the wild creatures of the world**.

---

## 🌍 **New Creatures Roam the Wilds**

The world now teems with new life. Keep your eyes open beyond the city walls:

**Mounts of the Nomads**

---

## 🍖 **The Art of Taming**

* Offer a creature the food it loves
* Watch for signs it’s willing to trust you
* Earn its loyalty
* Ride beside it as a true companion, not a master

Those who carry the right food may find beasts following them willingly.

✨ Look closely — creatures will show when your offering pleases them.

---

## 🐀 **A Small Companion**

Travelers whisper of a clever little creature known as the **Raton**.

* Fond of **Cheese**
* Shy, but loyal to those who earn its trust
* Will trail behind kind souls who treat it well

---

🏕️ **Choose your path, traveler.**  
Will you cross the plains atop a bison?  
Wander the forests with a stag at your side?  
Or earn the trust of something rarer?  

The wilds are watching.

## :lizard: PETS
A new expansion that breathes new life into Hytale’s wilderness. From the smallest woodland friends to towering elemental titans, every creature can be earned, hatched, and raised as your own loyal companion.  

### 🛠️ THE HUNT & HARVEST
**The path to companionship has evolved**. To bring a new friend into the world, you must now combine the thrill of the hunt with the skill of the farm.

### 🥚 THE BROKEN EGG SYSTEM
Peaceful wildlife no longer drop completed eggs. Instead, when defeated, they now have a rare chance to drop a **Broken Egg**. These fragile remnants contain the essence of the creature, but they are too damaged to hatch on their own.

### 🔨 THE FARMER'S WORKBENCH
To restore a companion, you must take the **Broken Egg** to your **Farming Workbench**. By "infusing" the shell with harvested goods, you can craft a functional Pet Egg.

The following companions must be restored at the Farming Workbench using a Broken Egg:

* **Mouse**
* **Penguin**
* **Dog**
* **Fox**
* **Bunny**
* **Lizard**
* **Pig**
* **Bison**
* **Camel**

### THE PREDATORS & MAGICAL (Loot Only)
To get these eggs, you must hunt and defeat the creature in the wild.
* **Cave Raptor** – [Requires: Defeat Cave Raptor]
* **Spider** – [Requires: Defeat Spider]
* **Wraith Lantern** – [Requires: Defeat Wraith]
* **Trillodon** – [Requires: Defeat Trillodon]

### THE ELEMENTAL GOLEMS (Loot Only)
Harness the power of the elements by defeating these ancient guardians.

* :fire: **Flame Golem** – [Requires: Defeat Flame Golem]
* :snowflake: **Frost Golem** – [Requires: Defeat Frost Golem]
* :seedling: **Earth Golem** – [Requires: Defeat Earth Golem]

# 22th of January

## Fixes
* Fixed a bug where chopping wood & other similar interactions would kick you.

# 21th of January

### Changes
* Reverted the **Tiered Progression System**, needs more work.

### Fixes
* Fixed a bug where if your bed was in an unloaded chunk it would tell your that your bed is obstructed and respawn you at the world spawn.

# 21th of January

# Revamped Progression
• **9-Tier Progression:** From humble Wood to legendary Onyxium.
• **Durability scaling:** Higher tier tools last exponentially longer - Onyxium has 100x the durability of Wood!
• **Rewarding Progression:** Each tier upgrade is a meaningful power boost.

**The Core Rules**
• **Tiered Mining:** You can only mine ores using the tool from the tier directly below it (or higher).
• **Specialization:** Tools now have strict roles:
    • **Pickaxes:** Rocks and Ores only.
    • **Axes:** Wood only.
    • **Shovels:** Soil and Sand only. (currently only go up to Cobalt tier, later will have more)
• **No Unarmed Harvesting:** Hand-gathering is highly inefficient or disabled for most blocks. Use the right tool for the job!

**Tool and Ore Tiers**
Progress through the world in this specific order:
1. **Wood** (Cannot mine ore; Stone only)
2. **Crude (Stone)**
3. **Copper**
4. **Iron**
5. **Thorium**
6. **Cobalt**
7. **Adamantite**
8. **Mithril** (Coming in Hytopia 1.0)
9. **Onyxium** (Coming in Hytopia 1.0)

**Getting Started (Pro-Tips)**
• **Scavenge First:** Since you can't punch trees effectively, start by picking up Sticks, Fiber, and Rubble (stone bits) directly off the ground.
• **Crafting:** Wood tools can be made by hand, but they are very weak.
• **Goal:** Build a Workbench immediately to unlock Crude (Stone) tools. This is where your real journey begins.

### Changes
* Updated to Update 1

You can set up a shop with /myshop manager, you need to create a tab (which is essentially a shop) and then you can hold an item and do /myshop add <tab> <buy price> <sell price> ... if it doesn't show up in /shops, do /myshop open

quick distinction: the buy price is the price of someone buying the item you are listing, the sell price is the price of someone selling the item listed TO you. the price you choose is for 1 quantity.

# 16th of January

### Fixes
Pickup Item Crash (Critical)
When a player disconnects while picking up an item, the world thread crashes and kicks ALL players in that world.

Error: ``NullPointerException`` in ``PickupItemSystem.tick()`` - null ``targetRef``
Fix: Safely marks corrupted pickup items as finished before they crash the server
RespawnBlock Crash (Critical)
When a player breaks a bed or sleeping bag, they get kicked from the server.

Error: ``NullPointerException`` in ``RespawnBlock$OnRemove`` - null ``respawnPoints`` array
Fix: Initializes the respawn points array before Hytale's buggy code runs
ProcessingBench Window Crash (Critical)
When a player breaks a campfire or crafting table while another player has it open, they get kicked from the server.

Error: ``NullPointerException`` in ``BenchWindow.onClose0`` - null ref during window close
Fix: Clears the windows map before the crash-causing close handlers run
Instance Exit Missing Return World (Critical)
When a player exits an instance (dungeon, cave, etc.) and the return world data is corrupted, they get kicked from the server.

Error: ``IllegalArgumentException`` in ``InstancesPlugin.exitInstance`` - Missing return world
Fix: Tracks player position before entering instances and uses it as fallback destination
Empty Archetype Entities (Monitoring)
Logs entities with corrupted/empty component data for debugging. These don't crash but indicate world data issues.

Chunk Memory Bloat
Hytale doesn't properly unload chunks when players move away, causing unbounded memory growth and eventual OOM crashes.

Symptoms: Server memory grows from 4GB to 14GB+ while players fly around; chunks never decrease
Example: Player loads 5,735 chunks, only 317 are in view radius, 5,400+ stay in memory forever
Fix: ``ChunkCleanupSystem`` runs on the main thread every 30 seconds to trigger Hytale's internal chunk cleanup
Results: Observed 77% reduction in loaded chunks (942 → 211) after fix
